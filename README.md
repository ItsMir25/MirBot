# MirBot
The code for my bot is pretty basic and simple. Nothing much but hope it helps.
This bot has been running since 2021, and have been improving ever since. But recently, the bot crashed due to the new update in api and my bot has stopped functioning ever since. I will be editing the code here from time to time but for now, it will be this.

the code is now useless because it hasnt updated to the latest version of the api which is discord.js v14, probably would update later on. 


;)
